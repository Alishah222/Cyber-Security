# Why Cyber Security Framework?
Cybersecurity frameworks provide a common set of guidelines and best practices for organizations to improve their cybersecurity posture and protect against potential cyber threats. The frameworks help organizations to identify and prioritize assets, assess risks, and implement measures to prevent and respond to security incidents. Having a simple and straightforward language makes it easier for organizations to understand and apply the framework, leading to better overall implementation and improvement in cybersecurity.
# Types of Cyber Security Framework
* ## NIST Cybersecurity Framework
 Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), it provides guidelines for organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.
* ## ISO 27001
 An international standard that outlines the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS).
 * ## Critical Security Control
 The Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) are a prioritized set of actions that organizations can take to improve their cybersecurity posture and defend against cyber threats. They were developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and are designed to be a practical and actionable approach to cybersecurity.
