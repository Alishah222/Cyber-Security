# what is cyber security?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and online assets from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and policies to secure sensitive data and prevent cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents.
## CIA TRAID
The CIA triad is a widely-used model for information security that outlines the three fundamental components of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* ### Confidentiality
Confidentiality refers to protecting information from unauthorized access and ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to those who are authorized to see it.

* ### Integrity 
Integrity refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information and ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or altered without detection.

* ### Availability
Avalability refers to ensuring that information is accessible and usable by authorized users when they need it.

The CIA triad is used as a framework to guide the development of information security policies and practices and to ensure that all aspects of security are considered and addressed in a comprehensive manner. 
# Threats And Attacks In CyberSecurity
* ## Malware
A malware attack is a type of cyber security threat where malicious software (malware) is intentionally installed on a computer or device to harm or gain unauthorized access to the system.
### Example 
malware includes viruses,worms,Trojans and spyware.
These attacks can cause harm to files, steal sensitive information, hold the system hostage (ransomware), and more. To protect against malware attacks, it is important to regularly update software and systems, use anti-virus software, avoid downloading unknown files and emails, and use strong passwords.
* ## Phishing
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker poses as a trustworthy entity in order to trick individuals into giving sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. 
### Example
email, social media, or fake websites that appear to be legitimate. 
Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and damage to computer systems. To protect against phishing, it is important to be cautious when receiving emails or messages from unknown or suspicious sources, not to click on links in unsolicited emails, and to verify the legitimacy of websites before entering personal information.
* ## DOS(Deniel of Service)
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is when a hacker tries to make a website or online service unavailable by overwhelming it with too much traffic. The hacker uses one computer to send a lot of requests to the website or service all at once, causing it to crash or become unavailable to users.
* ## DDoS(Distributed Deniel of Service)
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is when a hacker uses multiple computers to attack a website or online service. The hacker coordinates many computers to send a lot of requests to the website or service all at once, making it even more overwhelmed and unavailable to users. This type of attack is more powerful because it uses multiple computers to attack, rather than just one. 
* ## SQL injection attack
SQL Injection is a type of cyber attack that targets database-driven websites. The attacker inserts malicious code into a website's input fields, such as a login form or search box, in order to gain access to the underlying database. The injected code can allow the attacker to extract sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data stored in the database. It can also be used to alter, delete or modify the data in the database, potentially causing widespread damage. To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is important to validate all user inputs, use parameterized queries instead of constructing SQL statements dynamically, and implement proper authentication and authorization controls.
* ## Cross-Site Scripting attacks
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of cyber attack that involves injecting malicious code into a web page viewed by other users. The attacker does this by finding a vulnerability in a website's code that allows them to inject malicious script, which then runs in the browser of any user who visits the affected page. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information such as login credentials or other sensitive data, or to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as making unauthorized purchases or posting malicious content. To prevent XSS attacks, it is important to properly encode user input, validate user inputs, and to sanitize any data that is output to the web page. Additionally, using a Content Security Policy (CSP) can help prevent XSS attacks by explicitly specifying which sources of content are allowed to run in the user's browser.
* ## Man-in-the-Middle attack
A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is when a hacker intercepts communication between two parties, such as between a person and a website, and secretly listens in or changes the communication. The hacker acts as if they were the website and can steal sensitive information, like passwords or credit card numbers, or change the content of the communication without the two parties knowing. To prevent this type of attack, it is important to use secure connections and to verify the identity of the website or person you are communicating with.
* ## Passwords attacks
Password attacks are a type of cyber attack that target user passwords in order to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources.
### TYPES
* Brute Force Attack: This type of attack involves trying many different combinations of passwords and usernames in an attempt to guess the correct combination. 
* Dictionary Attack: This type of attack uses a list of commonly used passwords to attempt to gain access.
* Phishing Attack: This type of attack involves tricking users into revealing their passwords through fake login pages or other fraudulent methods.
* Rainbow Table Attack: This type of attack involves precomputing hashes of commonly used passwords and comparing them to hashes of passwords that have been stolen.
* Social Engineering Attack: This type of attack involves tricking people into revealing their passwords through psychological manipulation.
### To prevent password attacks, it is important to use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication when available, and to be cautious of suspicious emails or requests for sensitive information. Additionally, it is recommended to frequently change passwords and to use a password manager to securely store passwords.
