# what is cyber security?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and online assets from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and policies to secure sensitive data and prevent cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents.
## CIA TRAID
The CIA triad is a widely-used model for information security that outlines the three fundamental components of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* ### Confidentiality
Confidentiality refers to protecting information from unauthorized access and ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to those who are authorized to see it.

* ### Integrity 
Integrity refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information and ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or altered without detection.

* ### Availability
Avalability refers to ensuring that information is accessible and usable by authorized users when they need it.

The CIA triad is used as a framework to guide the development of information security policies and practices and to ensure that all aspects of security are considered and addressed in a comprehensive manner.
