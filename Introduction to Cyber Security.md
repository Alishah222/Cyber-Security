# what is cyber security?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and online assets from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and policies to secure sensitive data and prevent cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents.
## CIA TRAID
The CIA triad is a widely-used model for information security that outlines the three fundamental components of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* ### Confidentiality
Confidentiality refers to protecting information from unauthorized access and ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to those who are authorized to see it.

* ### Integrity 
Integrity refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information and ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or altered without detection.

* ### Availability
Avalability refers to ensuring that information is accessible and usable by authorized users when they need it.

The CIA triad is used as a framework to guide the development of information security policies and practices and to ensure that all aspects of security are considered and addressed in a comprehensive manner. 
## Threats And Attacks In CyberSecurity
* ### Malware
A malware attack is a type of cyber security threat where malicious software (malware) is intentionally installed on a computer or device to harm or gain unauthorized access to the system.
### Example 
malware includes viruses,worms,Trojans and spyware.
These attacks can cause harm to files, steal sensitive information, hold the system hostage (ransomware), and more. To protect against malware attacks, it is important to regularly update software and systems, use anti-virus software, avoid downloading unknown files and emails, and use strong passwords.
* ### Phishing
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker poses as a trustworthy entity in order to trick individuals into giving sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. 
### Example
email, social media, or fake websites that appear to be legitimate. 
Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and damage to computer systems. To protect against phishing, it is important to be cautious when receiving emails or messages from unknown or suspicious sources, not to click on links in unsolicited emails, and to verify the legitimacy of websites before entering personal information.
